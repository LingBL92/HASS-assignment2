        <b> Step 1</b>
        <br>The goal is to describe how 4 different components are concurrently considered such that 2 main routes towards zero carbon are derived.
      </td>
      <td>
        <b>Confusing data</b><br>
        Data in this case are the components and routes. The selection of these components are quite confusing and it is difficult to appreciate the visualisation.
        A lot of the namings seem to overlap and it adds to data condusion.
      </td>
      <td>
        <b>Colour junk</b>
        <br>Chart junk exists as colours. There are too many different colours and they do not combine to have any meaning at all.
        <br><b>Lack of hierachy</b>
        <br>The arrangement of icons do not convey the idea of a combination and they are all sized the same. The lack of hierachy makes it difficult to see a flow of events from left to right.
        <br><b>Improvement</b>
        <br>A single colour for the 4 components could make the story point more obvious.
        <br>Perhaps placing the 2 routes side by side (instead of top and bottom) could be useful, as it breaks the symmetry of the 4 circles on the left.

        <b>Clear quantitative values</b><br>
        Data on percentages and contributors are clear and consistent across all different fields.
      </td>
      <td>
        <b>Colour works</b>
        <br>In this case, the colours work well in separating the main contributors. Perhaps colours could be chosen to have more contrast.
        <br><b>Bad display of relative percentages</b>
        <br>Using rectangle sizes is really bad in showing relative differences. It is difficult to read size on 2 dimensions and we need to constantly refer to the numbers.
        <br><b>Improvement</b>
        <br>Using a simple bar chart would be more useful in showing relative differences across all contributors.
        <br>Stacked bar charts could be useful too, with the smaller contributors coloured using different hues of the main colour groupings.

      </td>
      <td>
        <b>Clear quantitative values?</b><br>
        The quantitative percentages are uniformly presented. However, percentages are relative and it is difficult to compare across different contributors as they have different initial contributions.
        The most important statistic for halving emissions is a small bar at the bottom.
        <b>Improvement</b>
        <br>The total emissions reduced should be presented at the top or more clearly.
      </td>

        <br>In this case, the colours work well in separating the main contributors. Perhaps colours could be chosen to have more contrast.

        <br>Using circle sizes is really bad in showing relative differences. It is difficult to read size on 2 dimensions and we need to constantly refer to the numbers.
        <br><b>Improvement</b>
        <br>Using a line scatter plot could combine both the total reduction and the various percentage decreases.
        <br>A line scatter plot could also make more sense in visualising percentage decrease.

        <b>Graphic illegibility</b>
        <br>While the past few sections had icons and graphics to provide more intuitive reading, this part just goes for all text.
        <br><b>Confusing heirachy</b>
        <br>The data in this case are all qualitative. This is the chance to use the rectangles and circles from previous parts. However, this graphic follows a stacked bar method (Which is better for quantitive data).
        <br><b>Improvement</b>
        <br>Using bubbles and circles would be so much more useful, firstly to convey some optimism in ideas, secondly to just demonstrate a spread of options with various impact factors.
        <br>Priority could then be coloured with hues, so as to keep the hierachy of the contribution groups.

        <td>
          <b>Straightforward data</b><br>
          Data is clear, the units of minutes is straightforward.
          Feels unneccessary to include the information on SPF 30+.
        </td>
        <td>
          <b>Confusing structure</b>
          <br>The top half with the clocks and coloured portions are very clear. But placing another 3 different types of information below the clocks make it confusing.
          It seems like we only need to consider skin colour in winter.
          <br><b>Improvement</b>
          <br>The idioms could be restructured based on the 2 main parameters: Human parameters and exposure time.
          <br>This way it is clear that the data is actually about different points.

          Location data is clear and the map projection is a familiar one.
          It is confusing to read the UV scale as increasingly less, could be simplified with decreasing.
        </td>
        <td>
          <b>Lacking legend</b>
          <br>Although the colours are quite clear, yellow means "in the sun", a legend will help to make it clearer.
          <br><b>Improvement</b>
          <br>There is an opportunity to combine this graphic with the clock idioms, since the sun positions can coincide with the seasonal exposure times.

          The percentages could be helpful and clear. But It would be helpful to see the total population numbers.
          The difference between inadequate and deficient is also arbitrary. Feels like deficint is a part of inadequate?

          <br>The bars can be stacked, if the subsets are not independent. Total population numbers can be expressed as part of the stacked bar.

          <b>Confusing data</b><br>
          It is difficult to make out what is the max recommended amount of vitamin D.
          Is it 100 or 250 mcg?
        </td>
        <td>
          <b>Confusing structure</b>
          <br>The 5 circles arranged in a line tells a story of increase. But the large one below feels out of place and is difficult to understand.
          <br><b>Improvement</b>
          <br>Since its meant to show increase, a line scatter plot or a bar chart is good enough. Sizing using circles is difficult to read.
          The overdose comment could be drawn to the inner circle, perhaps that will improve understanding.

        <td>
          <b>Arbitrary data</b><br>
          Perhaps the health problems are the top few in some survey. Because it is redundant to show heart disease and depression in the no evidence category.
          If no evidence, why not remove it?
        </td>
        <td>
          <b>Conflicting idioms</b>
          <br>There is one main direction, which is the strength of evidence (from left to right).
          However, the bubbles height makes it slightly confusing. Although they are roughly arranged to follow the strength of evidence as well.
          <br><b>Improvement</b>
          <br>I think the axis can be made more obvious and placed under the categories of slight, inconclusive...
          Then the bubbles can be flushed towards the axis. This will make the visualisation clearer in terms of what it is trying to convey.
